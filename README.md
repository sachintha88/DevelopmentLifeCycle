## What is a feature under development:

- Feature under development could include unconfirmed requirements and specifications.
- Feature under development might lack a finalized architecture and technology selection.
- Feature under development exhibit noticeable functional shortcomings.
- Feature under development may display evident bugs or experience crashes when users interact with components.
- Feature under development may show incomplete styling.

## What is a functional feature:

- A Functional feature should showcase all the UI components requested such as buttons, forms, menus, and widgets.
- A Functional feature should be responsive and should be able to complete all the requested functionalities without any obvious bugs. The feature should work reliably under various conditions and user interactions. It should not crash, freeze, or behave unpredictably. (unless the cause is an unexpected edge case)
- A Functional feature should accurately portray user interactions, animations, and transitions as as outlined in the design specifications. It should align with user needs and expectations. - - It should provide a lucid and intuitive user interface that allows users to achieve their objkectives with minimal friction.
- A Functional Feature should fulfill basic styling requirements.

- A Functional Feature should be ready for an initial QA, confirming the functionality, and identifying potential edge cases.

## Once it is functional, What's next:

- Enhance the feature to respond promptly to user interactions, ensuring a smooth and seamless user experience.
- Handle user input validation, edge cases, error messages, and feedback.
- Styling improvements.
- Develop any required client-side scripting or logic to enhance user experience.
- Implement data caching and synchronization mechanisms to optimize performance.
- Code Clean-up and a demostration adequate coding standards.
- Code review and final touches.
- Final QA and delivery.
